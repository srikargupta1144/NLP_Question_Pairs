I applied feature engineering on data and got the 7 features from data
 -> q1 len - char length of q1
 -> q2 len - char length of q2
 -> q1 words - # words in q1
 -> q2 words - # words in q2
 -> words common - # of common unique words
 -> words total - Total # words in q1 + Total # words in q2
 -> words share - word common/word total

 From around 4,00,000 rows, I am using only 30,000 rows data and made 7 new columns in it we add 3000 BOW for q1 and q2

 so now total number features will be 3000 + 3000 + 7 = 6007 features in total
